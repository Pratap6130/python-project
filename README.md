Project Prerequisites

To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

Tkinter is a standard GUI python library
base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.
To install the library we use pip install command on the command prompt

pip install tkinter
pip install base64
